# A blog site.

My first CRUD application built with Angular. The brief for this assignment was to build a blog site where a user could create, edit and delete blogs. Within the blogs the user can even create/edit/delete blog posts. There is also a comment section for each post.

## Installation and start

Clone the repo `https://github.com/MattSedmak/A_Blog_site.git`.

Run `npm install`.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
